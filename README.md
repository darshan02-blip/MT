Spam email detection with ML
Spam emails, commonly referred to as junk mail, are unsolicited messages sent to a large number of recipients. These emails often contain vague promotions, fraudulent schemes, or malicious phishing attempts. Their presence in our inboxes poses a significant inconvenience and potential security risks.

This project focuses on building a robust spam email detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify emails into two categories: spam or legitimate (ham). By automating this process, we can improve email filtering systems to effectively isolate harmful and unwanted messages.
